/**
\page Error_detection_and_reporting Error detection and reporting

Application code can disable or enable development-time error checking. These errors, which are related to validation of input parameters, are 
usually resolved at development if the parameters are static (i.e. known at compile time) and the overhead of these checks can be disabled in 
production.

S32 SDK drivers use an assert macro, DEV_ASSERT, to check the validity of input parameters. To enable the macro, one or two steps are necessary:
    - implementing a custom DEV_ASSERT macro in a custom file. This requires to define the CUSTOM_DEVASSERT symbol with the file name in the 
project configuration (for example: -DCUSTOM_DEVASSERT="custom_devassert.h")
    - define the DEV_ERROR_DETECT symbol in the project configuration to enable the assertion checks (for example: -DDEV_ERROR_DETECT).
    
If CUSTOM_DEVASSERT is not defined but DEV_ERROR_DETECT is defined, the DEV_ASSERT macro will use a default implementation.
